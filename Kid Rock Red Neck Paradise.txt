I like moonshine whiskey
I like home made wine
I don't look for greener grass
Home grown suits me just fine
Welcome to my shanty
Drop by anytime
I bet you'll like my Redneck Paradise
Redneck Paradise
It's a hole in the wall kinda small but the people are real nice
And folks in here they's free and clear
To drink beer and dance all night, that's right
It's a hole in the wall kinda small but the people are real nice
And when you're here you're free and clear to drink beer and dance all night, that's right
Cuz no one's uptight in Redneck Paradise
So rock on through to Redneck Paradise
