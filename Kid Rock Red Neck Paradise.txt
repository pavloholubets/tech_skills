Fast first on a rough road riding
High through the mountains climbing
Twistin', turning, further from my home
Young like a new moon rising
Fierce through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown
And I don't want no one to cry
But tell 'em if I don't survive
I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born free
Free like a river raging
Strong as the wind I'm facing
Chasing dreams and racing Father Time
Deep like the grandest canyon
Wild like an untamed stallion
If you can't see my heart, you must be blind
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can't keep no chains on me
I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born free
And I'm not good at long goodbyes
But look down deep into my eyes
I was born free
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Calm, facin' danger
Lost like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets
Close to my destination
Tired, frail. and aching
Waiting patiently for the sun to set
And when it's done, believe that I
Will yell it from that mountain high
I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born free
And I will bow to the shining seas
And celebrate God's grace on thee
I was born free
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
