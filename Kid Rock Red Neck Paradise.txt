I like moonshine whiskey
I like home made wine
I don't look for greener grass
Home grown suits me just fine
Welcome to my shanty
Drop by anytime
I bet you'll like my Redneck Paradise
Redneck Paradise
It's a hole in the wall kinda small but the people are real nice
And folks in here they's free and clear
To drink beer and dance all night, that's right
It's a hole in the wall kinda small but the people are real nice
