I like moonshine whiskey
I like home made wine
I don't look for greener grass
Home grown suits me just fine
Welcome to my shanty
Drop by anytime
I bet you'll like my Redneck Paradise
Redneck Paradise
We're gonna hit them honky tonks tonight
Down in Redneck Paradise
It's a hole in the wall kinda small just look for the red light
And have no fear you're free and clear to get wild and rock all night
We don't bite
Cuz we get down right in Redneck Paradise
Down in Redneck Paradise
It's a hole in the wall kinda small but the people are real, real nice
And when you're here you're free and clear to do what most ever you like, all night
So rock on through to Redneck Paradise
