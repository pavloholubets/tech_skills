How many of you people out there been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights sleepless?
How many lies, how many fights?
Well, why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
"Love is pain, " I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day
