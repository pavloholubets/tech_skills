I'm on the road, empty and cold
To a distant destination, I don't know
Been thinking about you, we back in days of all
It's hard to admit it, I still miss you, miss you so
Flashbacks of our memories, the past is my enemy
And I'm drowning in a sad melody
Flashbacks of our memory, the past is my enemy
It keeps holding, holding on me
Come break the silence
-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa-daa-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa
So far from home, but feelings were close
You're in my thoughts, my bed, my clothes when I'm alone
I find myself, my hands on the phone
But I'm holding up my feelings and letting you go
Flashbacks of our memories, the past is my enemy
And I'm drowning in a sad melody
Flashbacks of our memory, the past is my enemy
It keeps holding, holding on me
Come break the silence
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa-daa-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa-daa-daa-da
Hundreds of feelings confusing me
And making me so insecure, so insecure
Why you still holding me like never before?
'Cause hundreds of feelings confusing me
Flashbacks of our memories, the past is my enemy
And I'm drowning in a sad melody
Flashbacks of our memory, the past is my enemy
It keeps holding, holding on me
Come break the silence
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa-daa-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da
Dum-dam-da-daa-da-dii-daa-daa-daa-daa-daa-da
