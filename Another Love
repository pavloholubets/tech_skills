I wanna take you somewhere so you know (do you know?) I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils on a 



But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you last spring
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too last spring
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude

But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
Oh, need a love, now
My heart is thinking of
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours
I wanna sing a song, that'd be just ours

But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up
