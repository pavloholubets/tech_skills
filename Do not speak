DON'T SPEAK SONGTEXT
You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I′m losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though you′re letting go
And if it's real
Well, I don't want to know

Don′t speak
I know just what you′re sayin'
So please stop explainin′
Don't tell me ′cause it hurts
